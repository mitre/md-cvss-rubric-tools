The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help determine the urgency and priority of response. CVSS and its associated rubric and examples were developed for enterprise information technology systems and do not adequately reflect the clinical environment and potential patient safety impacts. MITRE--in collaboration with a working group of subject matter experts across the medical device ecosystem, including FDA, medical device manufacturers, healthcare delivery organizations, security experts, and safety/risk assessment experts--developed a rubric to provide more specific guidance guidance for applying CVSS to medical devices.

The rubic is structured as a series of questions at the decision points for assigning values to the elements of the CVSS vector. At the end of this process, the CVSS vector elements are assigned and an extended vector captures the answers to the questions at each decision point.

This repository provides tools for applying the rubric.
